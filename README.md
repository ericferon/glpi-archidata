# Archidata
Archidata plugin for GLPI

This plugin enables you to manage the data structures of your enterprise architecture.<br/>
A data asset can be decomposed in a hierarchy of other data asset, helping you to associate inventory items (typically applications, but also databases) to these data assets.<br/>
